## Getting Started

1. Install the dependencies

```
yarn install
```

2. Create a `.env.local` file with the following values, using your own firebase credentials

```
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGE_SENDER_ID==
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID=
REACT_APP_GAME_ID=
REACT_APP_NGROK_URL=
```

3. Run the project

```
yarn start
```

## NGROK

**IMPORTANT: This doesn't apply when being on build/production mode**

When developing, in case you want to use the scan-QR-codes feature for connecting to the game, we strongly recommend using [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) (or a similar tool). Basically what Ngrok does is exposing your local environment to the internet.

For starting this ngrok process you have to open a terminal tab and run:

```
./ngrok http --log-level "info" 3000
```

As you can see we are using the port 3000, but in case your pong project is being run in a different port then change it to the one you are using.

Then you need to open your `.env.local` file and set the ngrok url as the `REACT_APP_NGROK_URL` env variable value and run the game app again (via `npm run start` or `yarn start`).
